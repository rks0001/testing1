        On my website, I will occasionally evaluate or mention products and
        services. If I believe a product or service is good, and the merchant
        selling it provides an affiliate programme, I have no problem referring
        others to it via an affiliate link, which means I may receive a
        commission or other kind of income if you purchase the product I
        promote.
        <br />
        <br />
        Certain items and links to products/services are affiliate links, and
        any purchases you make may result in a commission for me. I am paid to
        give my honest opinion on products and/or services on occasion. You will
        not be charged any additional fees as a result of this.
        <br />
        <br />
        These items and services are mentioned because I believe in them and
        wish to assist you in improving your life. I only endorse products or
        services that I believe will benefit you. Of course, full disclosure:
        Making Sense of Cents is a for-profit business, which means I do make
        money from it.
        <br />
        <br />
        To make things easier for both of us, assume that any links to products
        or services are affiliate links and that I will be compensated if you
        buy something.
        <br />
        <br />
        Affiliate links are disclosed in accordance with the Federal Trade
        Commission&#39;s standards.
        <br />

        If you have any further questions, feel free to contact us.
        <br />
        Thanks!
